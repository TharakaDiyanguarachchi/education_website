        <h1>About Us Page</h1>
        <p>Online education is a flexible instructional delivery system that encompasses any kind of learning 
            that takes place via the Internet. Online learning gives educators an opportunity to reach students
             who may not be able to enroll in a traditional classroom course and supports students who need to 
             work on their own schedule and at their own pace.

            The quantity of distance learning and online degrees in most disciplines is large and increasing rapidly.
             Schools and institutions that offer online learning are also increasing in number. Students pursuing degrees
              via the online approach must be selective to ensure that their coursework is done through a respected and 
              credentialed institution.</p>
        <p>Online education has become a viable and exciting method for instructional delivery in the global 
            business society that runs on a 24/7 schedule (24 hours a day/7 days a week) because it provides students with great flexibility.

        <p>With the increased availability of the Internet and computer technology, students are able to access information 
            anytime and anyplace that would normally be available only through a traditional classroom. Studies have shown 
            that students learn just as effectively in an online classroom as they do in the traditional classroom.

            </p>
        <p>Online teaching is here to stay. Many students prefer the online classroom since it offers flexibility in their busy schedules.
             With the proliferation of information and knowledge, students must become lifelong learners in today's world, and online 
             education plays an important role in helping individuals access the learner-centered and self-directed instruction.

            With enhanced software, hardware, and Internet access, more options for online education will become available. 
            With student enrollments increasing faster than classrooms can be built, students becoming more proficient with
             technology, and students pursuing an education that meets their needs, the future of online education will continue 
             to grow. Online degree programs will become more widely accepted as they become a more common practice.</p>
